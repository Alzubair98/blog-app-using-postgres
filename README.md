# Blog app

> A project to write blogs for users : any user can sign in and post anything they want and other users can like and comment on other people posts

## Built With :hammer_and_wrench:

- **GitHub flow:** Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.
- **Linters Check:** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code.
